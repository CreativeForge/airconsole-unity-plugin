# AirConsole Unity Plugin

AirConsole provides a simple to use Javascript API for game developers to build 
their own local multiplayer realtime browser games controlled by smartphones.

The AirConsole-Unity-Plugin is a C# wrapper for the AirConsole Javascript API version 1.4.

## Unity Versions

This plugin works for Unity 5.6 and higher. If you are using an older unity version, please get the plugin from branch "unity-pre-5.6".

## Webserver
The plugin comes with an embedded webserver / websocket-server for 
the communication between the AirConsole backend and the Unity-Editor. 
You don't need to install any other webserver or services.
